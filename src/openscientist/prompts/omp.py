"""Oh My Pi (omp) prompt fragments.

Like the Codex fragments: omp surfaces skills natively (from ``.omp/skills/``),
so these drop the ``.claude/`` paths and the ``search_skills`` tool and use
omp's built-in ``read``/``write`` tools.

``OmpAgent`` runs omp with ``tools.xdev`` disabled, so the MCP tools are
top-level callable tools rather than ``xd://`` devices. omp namespaces them as
``mcp__<server>_<tool>``, which is what ``mcp_tool_prefix`` below renames the
shared prompt's mentions to.
