"""Codex agent prompt variants.

Codex reads its instructions from ``AGENTS.md`` and has no ``.claude/`` dir, so
the fragments drop the Claude paths and the ``Read`` tool name. Skills arrive as
native ``.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`` that codex auto-injects as a ``## Skills``
section, so the prompt points there and drops the ``search_skills`` tool.
