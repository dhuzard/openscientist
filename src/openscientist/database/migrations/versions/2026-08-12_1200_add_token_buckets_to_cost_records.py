"""Add cache and reasoning token columns to cost_records.

TokenUsage has always carried five non-overlapping buckets, but only input and
output were persisted. Cached reads dominate agentic runs -- every turn resends
the conversation -- so cost computed from two buckets understates reality
without any sign that it has, and per-model token comparisons are meaningless.
