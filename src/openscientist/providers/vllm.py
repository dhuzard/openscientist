"""vLLM provider (self-hosted open-weight models on an OpenAI-compatible wire).

Routes an agent at a self-hosted vLLM server (default
``http://localhost:8000/v1``). A vLLM server serves exactly the model it was
launched with, so ``OPENSCIENTIST_MODEL`` must name it.
Auth is optional: a server started with ``--api-key`` needs ``VLLM_API_KEY``,
otherwise the provider is keyless like Ollama.

Driven by omp, not by Codex. It speaks the OpenAI wire, but Codex's MCP tool
calls come back "unsupported call" against non-gptoss models, which degrades a
run to writing files instead of recording artifacts, so no Codex contract is
implemented here.

Because the server runs outside the app, the base URL must be reachable
from wherever the agent runs. In-process on the dev box ``localhost`` works
directly. From inside the agent container, point ``VLLM_BASE_URL`` at the
host (for example ``http://host.docker.internal:8000/v1``).
