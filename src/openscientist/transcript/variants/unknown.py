    one MUST also log a WARNING naming the source SDK and the
    unrecognised ``type`` discriminator so live drift surfaces in
    operational logs even before tests catch it.

    Tests count ``UnknownEntry`` occurrences against committed
    fixtures: a nonzero count in a real-data fixture fails CI and
